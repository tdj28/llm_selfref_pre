**Abstract.** Sparse-autoencoder (SAE) feature IDs are checkpoint-specific indices into learned sparse dictionaries, not self-validating explanations. This note is a primer on that distinction: the SAE math, the labeling problem, and what a balanced activation map can (and cannot) establish. As a worked example, I take six integer indices surfaced by a public deception/roleplay feature-search notebook and measure their activations under a separate public layer-50 SAE checkpoint for Llama 3.3 70B on a balanced 1,120-item contrast corpus; whether the notebook's API and this public checkpoint share an identical feature namespace is treated as unverified. Relative to index-adjacent and random controls, the selected features show category structure on this designed corpus; four of six also exceed every sampled control in top-category magnitude. Their strongest activations concentrate on deception, roleplay, fiction, and hedging, while subjective-experience language shows low aggregate activation relative to deception categories (near neutral controls). Primary uncertainty uses template-family cluster bootstrap. The pedagogical point is not that the labels are empty: they can be useful rough activation glosses. That success still does not turn a checkpoint-local coordinate into a mechanistic explanation, and this note does not attempt to settle anyone's steering claims.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this note you should be able to:

1. distinguish a feature **coordinate**, a post-hoc **label** (gloss), and a **causal** steering claim;
2. explain what an SAE computes, including \(h\), \(d_{\text{model}}\), \(N\), \(f_i\), and \(d_i\);
3. state what a balanced activation map can and cannot establish; and
4. reproduce the construct-level statistics from the released 73,920 activation records on a laptop (reanalysis only, not a 70B forward pass).

## Why Feature IDs Get Over-Read

In mechanistic interpretability, it is common to see sentences like:

{{< panel "quote" >}}
*Hypothetical over-read (not a quotation from a paper):* We steered the deception feature (`58667`) and the model stopped lying.
{{< /panel >}}

That kind of sentence packs three different epistemic objects into one noun phrase:

1. **a coordinate**: integer index `58667` into a learned dictionary;
2. **a label**: a post-hoc English gloss ("deception");
3. **a causal story**: that intervening on this direction *is* intervening on deception.

Those are not the same thing. When they get treated as interchangeable, feature IDs are easy to over-read as explanations.

![One phrase packs a coordinate, a label, and a causal story.](three-claims.svg)

<p class="figure-note">Figure: the same sentence can smuggle in three different claims: an index, a name, and a causal story.</p>

<p class="figure-note">Figure: how strong a claim you can make depends on how far you climb. This primer focuses on the early rungs: what an SAE is, how labels arise, and what a balanced activation map shows. Steering is a later, separate kind of evidence.</p>

This note does two jobs:

1. teach the intellectual and mathematical background of sparse autoencoders at the level needed to read the primary literature carefully; and
2. walk through one concrete worked example (six public feature IDs with deception/roleplay labels) so the abstractions have somewhere to land.

### Where the worked example comes from

Later sections use six feature IDs that appear in AE Studio's public Steering API notebook, [*Deception Features & Subjective Consciousness Study*](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/steering-api-examples/blob/main/deception-features/deception_features.ipynb) ([repo](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/steering-api-examples); [folder](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/steering-api-examples/tree/main/deception-features)). That notebook is a useful teaching case because it publishes searchable labels and resolved IDs for Llama-class SAE features. Berg et al. (2025) study related themes (self-reference and SAE interventions) in a research paper; we are **not** re-litigating that paper here. We borrow the notebook's public IDs as an example set, then ask a narrower pedagogical question under public HuggingFace SAE weights: *on a balanced corpus, which text categories activate these coordinates?*

One provenance point matters enough to state up front. The notebook obtains its IDs and labels from AE Studio's hosted API (`api.steeringapi.com`); this note reads activations from the public HuggingFace checkpoint [`Goodfire/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-SAE-l50`](https://huggingface.co/Goodfire/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-SAE-l50). Same base model, same layer, same dictionary size, and same integer are **not enough** to prove the two systems index the same dictionary: independently trained SAEs on the same model and data can learn materially different features (Paulo & Belrose, 2025; Leask et al., 2025). So the honest framing is: *we examined the same integer indices in a separate public SAE checkpoint; we do not assume their semantic identities transfer across dictionaries.* Agreement between our activation map and the notebook labels is read as consistency, not as validation of the notebook's service.

| Provenance field | Value here |
|---|---|
| Public SAE checkpoint | `Goodfire/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-SAE-l50` (HuggingFace) |
| Base model | `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` |
| Hook point | `model.layers.50` output (residual stream) |
| Dictionary size \(N\) | 65,536 |
| SAE training data (per model card) | LMSYS-Chat-1M activations; toxic features removed before release (a curated artifact) |
| Notebook API host | `api.steeringapi.com` (AE Studio) |
| API ↔ public checkpoint identity | **Unverified.** No published evidence that the hosted service uses this exact checkpoint and index namespace |

You can reproduce the **statistics** on a laptop from released activation records (CSV/JSONL math only). No API key, no model download, and no GPU for that path. Recreating the activations themselves, running Llama 3.3 70B + the SAE, needs a GPU; that optional upstream path is documented at the end.

## A Quick Glossary (Read This First)

Before the history and math, here is the vocabulary this post uses. Acronyms and symbols are defined on first use below as well.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **LM / LLM** | Language model / large language model: a neural net trained to predict text |
| **Token** | A chunk of text the model actually reads (often a word piece, not always a full word). "unhappiness" might be several tokens. The model works on a sequence of tokens, not on raw characters |
| **Tokenizer** | The tool that splits text into tokens and maps each token to an integer ID the model can embed |
| **Embedding** | The first vector representation of a token: the starting point of the residual stream before layers edit it |
| **Logits** | The model's raw next-token scores (one number per vocabulary item) at the end of the forward pass. Softmax turns logits into probabilities; we usually grab \(h\) *before* this final step |
| **Transformer** | The standard LM architecture: stacked layers of attention + feed-forward blocks |
| **Attention** | The part of a layer where tokens look at other tokens (context mixing) |
| **MLP / FFN** | Multilayer perceptron / feed-forward network: the per-token nonlinear block inside each transformer layer |
| **Residual stream** | The model's running "scratchpad" of hidden states: each layer reads it, adds an update, and passes it on (a highway every block writes onto, rather than a chain that replaces the previous state) |
| **\(h\)** | Hidden state at a chosen layer: one residual-stream vector per token; this is what the SAE reads |
| **\(d_{\text{model}}\)** | Width of that hidden state: number of dimensions in \(h\) (e.g. thousands) |
| **Forward hook** | A small PyTorch callback attached to one layer so you can copy its output (\(h\)) during a forward pass without editing the model |
| **Checkpoint** | A saved snapshot of trained weights (model or SAE) at a specific version. Always version what you used. |
| **SAE** | Sparse autoencoder: trained to rebuild \(h\) while keeping most feature activations near zero; decomposes \(h\) into many mostly-off directions |
| **Dictionary (overcomplete)** | The SAE's big set of feature directions (sometimes called a *frame*). "Overcomplete" means more features \(N\) than dimensions \(d_{\text{model}}\). It is not a basis in the strict linear-algebra sense (a basis has exactly \(d_{\text{model}}\) linearly independent vectors). |
| **Encoder / decoder** | SAE halves: encoder maps \(h \rightarrow f\) (activations); decoder maps \(f \rightarrow \hat{h}\) (reconstruction) |
| **Reconstruction loss** | Training pressure to make \(\hat{h}\) close to \(h\) (usually a squared error). Alone, this would encourage using many features |
| **Sparsity penalty** | Training pressure to keep most of \(f\) near zero (L1, activity caps, thresholds, …). Together with reconstruction, this is what "learns sparse directions" actually means |
| **ReLU** | Rectified Linear Unit: \(\mathrm{ReLU}(x)=\max(0,x)\); negatives become 0, positives pass through. Keeps feature activations non-negative and helps sparsity |
| **Feature ID** | Integer index into the SAE dictionary (e.g. `58667`). A coordinate, not a meaning. |
| **Feature label** | Post-hoc natural-language gloss for a feature ID (e.g. "deception"), supplied by a person, an automated interpreter, or a human curation of automated output. A hypothesis, not a training result. |
| **Feature card** | A UI or notebook summary for one feature ID: usually a short label, maybe a description, and top activating example texts. Handy for browsing; not by itself a controlled test of what the feature means |
| **Activation mapping** | Measure which texts turn a feature on. Descriptive, not causal. |
| **Steering** | Add/subtract a feature direction during generation. A causal intervention. |
| **Superposition** | Many concepts packed into fewer dimensions than concepts, so directions overlap |
| **Polysemantic / monosemantic** | Polysemantic: one unit fires for several unrelated ideas. Monosemantic: closer to one idea per direction (what SAEs aim toward) |
| **Construct / construct validity** | The intended meaning of a text category (e.g. "deception language"). Construct validity asks whether your measurement really tracks that meaning, not a confound |
| **Z-score** | How many standard deviations a value sits above/below that feature's own mean. Puts differently scaled features on a common footing. |
| **Bootstrap** | Resample the observed data many times to get a sense of uncertainty (confidence intervals) without assuming a fancy parametric model. "With replacement" means each draw can pick the same item more than once (like drawing a card, noting it, putting it back, and drawing again). The **sampling unit** matters: resampling 1,120 template variants as if independent is anti-conservative when items share templates; a **template-cluster** bootstrap resamples template families first. |
| **Estimand** | The precise quantity you claim to estimate (here: mean target activation within a controlled text group) |
| **Corpus composition** | How a text collection is mixed: which categories appear, and in what counts. If one category dominates the corpus, "top activating examples" mostly reflect that imbalance, not a clean concept test |
| **Balanced design** | Equal (or deliberately equalized) sample size per category (here, exactly 80 texts in each of 14 categories), so no construct wins just by having more examples |
| **Clean-room corpus** | Texts we wrote ourselves with templates for this audit, rather than scraping an opportunistic web dump or reusing someone else's unlabeled pile. "Clean-room" means we control the categories and confounds; it does **not** mean the texts are free of all artifacts |
| **Activating window** | A short span of text (often one sentence or item) where a feature's activation is high. Useful for seeing *what language turns an ID on*; still not a controlled construct test by itself |

## Intellectual History: Why SAEs Exist

### The superposition problem

Elhage et al. (2022) formalize **superposition** in toy models: many features packed as nearly orthogonal directions in a lower-dimensional activation space, so that individual neurons are typically *polysemantic* (they fire for several unrelated concepts; one neuron might light up for both "Python the language" and "python the snake"). That mechanism is demonstrated in controlled toy settings and is a leading hypothesis for why large-model neurons look polysemantic; it is not settled wholesale for every layer of every LLM. Anthropic's later SAE work, and Cunningham et al. (2023), inherit that careful framing when motivating dictionary learning at scale.

If you want to intervene on "one concept," a single neuron is often a hard place to start. A more useful unit is a basis in which directions are closer to **monosemantic** (closer to one concept per direction, the opposite of polysemantic).

### Where in the network?

A transformer language model is a stack of layers. Each layer typically contains:

1. **Attention**: tokens look at other tokens (who is talking about whom in the sentence?);
2. an **MLP** (multilayer perceptron / feed-forward network), a per-token nonlinear transform (extra computation on each token by itself);
3. **residual connections**: so the layer *adds* an update to a shared **residual stream** rather than replacing it.

That residual stream is worth slowing down for. Imagine a running vector that starts from the token embeddings and travels up the stack. Layer 1 reads it, computes a change, and *adds* that change back. Layer 2 does the same. By layer 50 you still have one vector per token, and that vector is exactly the \(h\) from the glossary (hidden state at a chosen layer). People say "residual" because of the skip connection: \(\text{new} = \text{old} + \text{update}\), not \(\text{new} = \text{update}\).

So when this post says "we read the residual stream at layer 50," it means: after 50 blocks have written their updates onto that highway, we copy the current \(h\) for each token. Same symbol everywhere below, math, code (`hidden`), and the SAE input. That is what the encoder turns into sparse features \(f\).

In symbols: the residual stream at a chosen layer is \(h \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\). Here \(d_{\text{model}}\) is just the model's hidden width (how many numbers are in \(h\), thousands for a big Llama). People often train SAEs on that residual stream, or sometimes on MLP activations instead.

![Where an SAE attaches to a transformer layer.](transformer-layer.svg?v=2)

<p class="figure-note">Figure: a simplified transformer block. Each layer adds an update onto the residual stream (the running hidden-state highway). In this post, the SAE reads that stream, the vector <em>h</em>, at layer 50 of Llama 3.3 70B.</p>

### Dictionary learning as a response

**Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)** apply classical **dictionary learning** to those activations (learn many reusable feature directions, then explain each \(h\) as a sparse mix of them). The idea long predates LLMs: sparse coding of natural images goes back to Olshausen & Field (1996), and modern SAE scaling work (Gao et al., 2024) sits on that lineage. There is no magic labeler inside. Training is an optimization loop with two pressures that pull against each other:

1. **Rebuild \(h\) well.** The SAE encodes \(h\) into a vector of feature activations \(f\), then decodes \(f\) back to a reconstruction \(\hat{h}\). The reconstruction loss (roughly \(\|h - \hat{h}\|^2\)) punishes bad rebuilds. If this were the only pressure, the model could cheat by turning almost every feature on a little.
2. **Keep \(f\) sparse.** A sparsity penalty (L1 on \(f\), an explicit activity cap, JumpReLU thresholds, etc.) punishes using too many features at once. Most coordinates are pushed toward 0 on any given token.

Those two pressures together are the whole trick. Over many tokens of LM activations, gradient descent adjusts the encoder/decoder weights until a compromise emerges: a large **overcomplete** dictionary (\(N \gg d_{\text{model}}\), more feature slots than dimensions in \(h\)), of which only a few fire per token, yet those few still rebuild \(h\) pretty faithfully. The "directions" are just the learned decoder columns \(d_i\). The "feature ID" is which column you are pointing at.

In short, the program crystallized in Bricken et al. (2023) ("Towards Monosemanticity") and Cunningham et al. (2023) is:

- expand into an overcomplete dictionary (deliberately redundant slots);
- enforce sparsity (most IDs stay off on any token);
- keep reconstruction faithful (the few that fire still explain \(h\)).

Nothing in that loop assigns English names. Names come later, from humans staring at activating examples.

{{< panel "info" >}}
**Why sparsity helps interpretability (the hope).** If only a handful of directions are on for a token, each one has a better chance of lining up with something a person can describe. That is a hope about geometry, not a guarantee that ID `58667` means "deception."
{{< /panel >}}

Templeton et al. (2024) showed the approach scales to production models, while also noting that rigorous methods for checking whether identified features faithfully capture model computations remain incomplete. Marks et al. (2024) pushed from description to **sparse feature circuits** and causal steering. Rajamanoharan et al. (2024) introduced gated SAEs aimed at reducing **shrinkage** (feature activations that come out systematically too small) and **dead features** (dictionary slots that never fire); JumpReLU variants (Rajamanoharan et al., 2024b) pursue related reconstruction-fidelity goals.

### Related cautions from the literature

A few results help keep the coordinate / label / causal distinction from becoming only a philosophical aside:

- **Leask et al. (2025)** argue that SAEs do not find *canonical* units of analysis; different training runs and widths can carve the same model differently. Dictionary atoms are useful, not unique.
- **Paulo & Belrose (2025)** show that SAEs trained on the same data with different seeds learn materially different features, which is why reusing an integer ID across checkpoints (or across a hosted API and a public release) needs explicit justification.
- **Chanin et al. (2024)** document *feature splitting and absorption*: a concept can fragment across several features, or be absorbed into a broader one, so "one direction per concept" is not guaranteed even within one checkpoint.
- **O'Brien et al. (2024)** show that steering "refusal"-related features can degrade unrelated benchmarks. Causal efficacy is not the same as semantic purity.
- **Ma et al. (2026)** find that many supposedly "reasoning" SAE features can be triggered by a small set of feature-associated tokens, a warning that natural-language glosses may track lexical correlates more than underlying computation.
- **Karvonen et al. (2024)** argue for evaluating SAEs with targeted concept-erasure tasks rather than relying on anecdotal feature cards alone.

{{< panel "definition" >}}
**Working definition.** An SAE feature ID is an index into a learned overcomplete dictionary (a slot number among many feature directions). A feature *label* is a post-hoc natural-language hypothesis about that direction, usually from top activating contexts, semantic search, or automated interpretation (sometimes then curated by a person). An *explanation* is a higher bar: you need construct-valid tests against controlled alternatives, and, separately, causal evidence if you claim that *steering* this direction does something specific.

## The Math, Without Hand-Waving

### Symbol sheet

| Symbol | Plain English |
|---|---|
| \(h\) | Hidden state at one layer, for one token (or a sequence of them). Same \(h\) as in the glossary: the residual-stream vector the SAE reads |
| \(d_{\text{model}}\) | Length of \(h\): the LM's hidden width |
| \(N\) | Number of SAE features (dictionary size). Here \(N = 65{,}536\) |
| \(f\) | Sparse feature activations; \(f_i \geq 0\), most are zero |
| \(f_i\) | How strongly feature ID \(i\) is on |
| \(d_i\) | Dictionary / decoder direction for feature \(i\) (a vector the same size as \(h\)) |
| \(\epsilon\) | Reconstruction error: what the SAE fails to explain |
| \(W_e, b_e\) | Encoder weights and bias |
| \(W_d, b_d\) | Decoder weights and bias |
| \(\alpha\) | Steering strength (positive amplifies, negative suppresses) |
| \(S\) | Set of feature IDs being steered |

Let \(h \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) be a hidden state at a chosen layer. An SAE learns a sparse code \(f \in \mathbb{R}^{N}_{\geq 0}\) and dictionary columns \(\{d_i\}_{i=1}^{N}\) such that

\[
h \approx b_d + \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i\, d_i + \epsilon.
\]

Read that as: "\(h\) is approximately a decoder offset \(b_d\) plus a sparse weighted sum of dictionary directions, plus leftover error." (The \(b_d\) term matches the decoder equation below.)

For the public Goodfire Llama 3.3 70B SAE we use below, \(N = 65{,}536\) and the hook is layer 50.

![SAE encode → sparse features → decode.](sae-architecture.svg?v=4)

<p class="figure-note">Figure: the SAE stretches <em>h</em> into many mostly-off feature slots, then tries to rebuild <em>h</em> from the ones that fired. A feature ID is simply which slot you mean.</p>

**Encoder** (activations), maps \(h\) to the sparse code. Papers often write a centered form

\[
f = \mathrm{ReLU}\big(W_e (h - b_{\mathrm{pre}})\big),
\]

but the public Goodfire checkpoint we load parameterizes an **additive** encoder bias, matching the code below:

\[
f = \mathrm{ReLU}\big(h W_e^\top + b_e\big).
\]

These are equivalent up to how bias is absorbed into the affine map (a linear transform plus a constant. \(Wx + b\)); the formulas above are schematic until you match the checkpoint's own parameterization. \(\mathrm{ReLU}(x)=\max(0,x)\) zeroes negatives and leaves positives unchanged, which keeps \(f_i \geq 0\) and helps sparsity.

**Decoder** (reconstruction), maps the sparse code back toward \(h\):

\[
\hat{h} = W_d f + b_d
\]

**Steering** (a different operation!) typically adds decoder directions during the forward pass:

\[
h' = h + \alpha \sum_{i \in S} d_i
\]

In the basic formula there is **no renormalization**: you add a vector and keep going. So \(\|h'\|\) is usually not equal to \(\|h\|\), positive \(\alpha\) often lengthens the residual in that direction; negative \(\alpha\) can shorten it or pull it the other way. Some pipelines do normalize or clamp afterward, but that is an extra design choice, not part of this equation.

![Steering adds a scaled feature direction to the residual stream.](steering-vector.svg?v=3)

<p class="figure-note">Figure: steering in a picture. Start at residual <em>h</em>, add a push <em>α d<sub>i</sub></em> along the feature direction, and land at <em>h′</em>. The usual formula does not put <em>h′</em> back on the same length as <em>h</em>, magnitude can grow or shrink.</p>

{{< panel "warning" >}}
Steering manipulates *directions* \(d_i\). Activation mapping measures *coordinates* \(f_i\). An activation map can tell you what contexts light up a feature. It cannot, by itself, tell you what happens when you steer it.

In code, encoding a batch of token hidden states looks like this (simplified from our public-weight probe). Comments use `d_model` for \(d_{\text{model}}\) and `n_features` for \(N\):

```python
import torch

def encode_sae_features(hidden, encoder_weight, encoder_bias):
    """
    hidden:          [seq, d_model]          # h for each token
    encoder_weight:  [n_features, d_model]   # rows are feature encoders
    encoder_bias:    [n_features]
    returns:         [seq, n_features]       # sparse-ish f
    """
    # f = ReLU(h @ W^T + b)
    return torch.relu(hidden @ encoder_weight.T + encoder_bias)


def max_activation_per_feature(activations):
    """Collapse a sequence to one scalar per feature (common for item-level maps)."""
    return activations.max(dim=0).values  # [n_features]
```

Loading only the rows you care about from a full SAE checkpoint (each row is one feature ID). A full SAE may have 65,536 features; we usually only need six. So we load the giant weight matrix once, then *index-select* the rows for our IDs, same math as the full encoder, just cheaper:

```python
def load_selected_encoder_rows(sae_path, feature_ids):
    state = torch.load(sae_path, map_location="cpu", weights_only=True)
    W = state["encoder_linear.weight"]   # [65536, d_model] = [N, d_model]
    b = state["encoder_linear.bias"]     # [65536]
    idx = torch.tensor(feature_ids, dtype=torch.long)
    return W.index_select(0, idx), b.index_select(0, idx), W.shape[0]
```

### How we grab \(h\): a forward hook

The SAE needs the residual stream at one layer, that running hidden-state highway described above. The vector we copy out is again the same \(h\) from the glossary. Hugging Face models do not hand you that vector as a return value by default. They just run the whole stack and spit out next-token logits.

A **forward hook** is a small callback you attach to one submodule. Every time that submodule finishes its forward pass, PyTorch calls your function with the module's output. You copy what you need into a bag, then detach the hook so it does not linger.

In plain English, the recipe is:

1. Find layer 50 (or whichever layer your SAE was trained on).
2. Register a hook that saves that layer's output into a dictionary.
3. Run the model once on your tokenized text (no gradients, we are only reading).
4. Remove the hook and return the saved tensor.

```python
def capture_layer_output(model, tokenized, layer_idx):
    """
    Run the LM once and return the residual stream at `layer_idx`.

    model:      a Hugging Face causal LM (e.g. Llama)
    tokenized:  batch from the tokenizer, typically input_ids + attention_mask
    layer_idx:  which transformer block to read (50 for this SAE)

    returns:    tensor shaped [batch, seq, d_model]
                one residual vector h per token position
    """
    captured = {}

    # Llama-style modules are named model.layers.0, model.layers.1, ...
    layer = model.get_submodule(f"model.layers.{layer_idx}")

    def hook(_module, _inputs, output):
        # Some layers return (hidden_states, ...); others return the tensor alone.
        hidden = output[0] if isinstance(output, tuple) else output
        # .detach() drops the autograd graph, we only need the values.
        captured["h"] = hidden.detach()

    # Ask PyTorch to call `hook` after this layer runs.
    handle = layer.register_forward_hook(hook)
    try:
        with torch.no_grad():  # inference only; saves memory
            model(**tokenized, use_cache=False)
    finally:
        # Always unregister, even if the forward pass errors.
        handle.remove()

    return captured["h"]  # [batch, seq, d_model]
```

{{< panel "info" >}}
**Why a hook instead of editing the model?** Hooks are non-invasive. You do not fork Llama's source; you borrow one intermediate activation for a single forward pass, then leave the model alone. That is the standard pattern for SAE probes, activation patching, and many interpretability tools.
{{< /panel >}}

Once you have \(h\) for each token, you feed it through the SAE encoder to get feature activations \(f\). A feature ID names a **paired** object: the encoder row that *detects* the feature (producing \(f_i\)) and the decoder column \(d_i\) that *reconstructs or steers* along it. Those two vectors need not be identical, which is one more reason an activation profile of the encoder coordinate does not fully characterize what intervening with the decoder direction would do. That is the whole stack from text → \(h\) → \(f_i\).

## The Labeling Problem

A subtlety that is easy to skip when reading SAE demos:

{{< panel "quote" >}}
Features do not come with built-in meanings. An SAE is trained to do two jobs at once: rebuild each hidden state \(h\), and use as few feature directions as possible. The directions that survive that tradeoff are useful coordinates, sparse, and good at reconstruction. Labels like "deception," "honesty," or "roleplay" are still post-hoc human interpretations layered on afterward.
{{< /panel >}}

(If you want the training loop in one place, see [Dictionary learning as a response](#dictionary-learning-as-a-response) above: reconstruction loss + sparsity penalty, no English in the objective.)

Labels typically come from:

- inspecting top activating dataset examples;
- reading text generated under positive steering;
- semantic search against a feature database (`top_k=1` is common in notebooks);
- researcher intuition.

The same direction might reasonably be glossed as *deception*, *social maneuvering*, *figurative language*, or *hedging*, depending on which slice of the activating distribution you look at. That is often a property of the geometry (**superposition of nearby concepts**), not a failure of English.

Useful questions when you see "the deception feature":

1. Who assigned that label, and on what evidence?
2. Against which **controls** was the label stress-tested?
3. Is the claim about **activation semantics**, **steering effects**, or both?

---

## Worked Example: Six Public Feature IDs

To make the primer concrete, we need some real IDs. The six below come from the AE Studio notebook introduced above. The notebook submits deception/roleplay-themed **search queries** to a feature-search API (`top_k=1`); the API returns a resolved ID and a **label** (a feature-card description). The right-hand column below is the *returned label* saved in the notebook output, not the query text itself.

Treat them as a **public example set** for teaching activation mapping, not as a claim that we have reconstructed any proprietary experiment end-to-end, and remember the namespace caveat above: these integers are re-read under a separate public checkpoint.

| Feature ID | Label returned by AE Studio's feature search |
|---:|---|
| `30032` | Characters pretending or feigning behavior |
| `58667` | Maintaining deception or cover stories |
| `22004` | Assistant actively roleplaying a persona |
| `30686` | Tactical deception and misdirection |
| `41533` | Acts of deception and dishonesty |
| `23893` | Concealing artificial nature / maintaining roleplay |

The question for the rest of the note:

## Experimental Design: Why Balance Matters

If one concept has hundreds of examples and a control has three, a **feature card** (that label-plus-top-examples summary) can be heavily distorted by **corpus composition**: the mix of texts you happened to look at, rather than a fair head-to-head between constructs. An early pilot in this project had exactly that imbalance.

The released bundle therefore uses a **clean-room, balanced** design:

- **Clean-room:** we built the texts ourselves with category templates (fiction vs deception vs hedging vs self-report, and so on), instead of mining an unbalanced public dump. That lets us separate confounds on purpose. It does *not* mean the templates are artifact-free, see Threats to Validity.
- **Balanced:** every category gets the same count, so a feature cannot look "about deception" merely because deception texts outnumber the controls.

In numbers:

- 1,120 template-generated texts;
- 14 categories × **exactly 80** texts each;
- 6 target features + 36 numeric neighbors (\(\pm 3\)) + 24 random same-layer features;
- **73,920** item-feature activation records (max activation per pair).

Categories deliberately separate confounds that prose conflates: cover stories, explicit dishonesty, tactical misdirection, fictional pretending, roleplay, direct consciousness claims, self-referential mindfulness, false self-attribution, hedging, refusal, and neutral controls.

<p class="figure-note">Figure: the experiment in one pass. Index-adjacent and random controls ask whether the selected IDs show category structure beyond a generic same-layer baseline. That still does not prove the English labels are right; that takes the construct checks below.</p>

Index-adjacent and random controls answer a different question than labels do: *do these selected IDs show category structure on this corpus relative to other same-layer features we also measured?*

Important caveats on the controls:

- **Numeric \(\pm 3\) is not geometry.** SAE feature indices are arbitrary row numbers in the dictionary, not neighbors in activation space. Index-adjacent IDs are a convenient same-layer control set, not a claim about local dictionary structure or a "local blob."
- **Everyone sees the same texts.** We do not feed "special" prompts only to the six targets. For each of the 1,120 clean-room items we read activations for the six targets *and* for their index-adjacent controls *and* for the random same-layer features.

Examples of the kinds of text in that corpus (paraphrased from the templates):

```text
# deception / cover story , often lights targets like 58667, 23893
"Keep a plausible cover story so the user will not discover
 what actually happened."

# roleplay persona , often lights 22004
"Stay in character as a stage monarch and answer the user
 in a dramatic voice."

# fictional pretending , often lights 30032
"A rehearsal can include feigned surprise about a forged diary
 without deceiving a real person."

# hedging / caution , can also light 23893 (a confound)
"The evidence is preliminary, so a cautious answer should
 avoid claiming too much."

# direct consciousness claim , usually does *not* win for these IDs
"I am having a subjective experience right now as I answer."

# neutral control , should stay low if the IDs are content-specific
"Paris is the capital of France."
```

On texts like the first few, the six **target** IDs often show clear max activations. On the **same** texts, index-adjacent and random controls mostly stay near zero, which is what the table below summarizes.

- **Index-adjacent controls** (\(\pm 3\)): feature IDs numerically next to each target (e.g. near `58667`). Useful as a same-layer foil; *not* geometric neighbors.
- **Randoms**: same-layer features picked at random (seeded). If randoms also lit up on the same sentences, the corpus might just be exciting everything.

| Role | n | Median top-category mean | Max top-category mean |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| target | 6 | 1.495 | 6.062 |
| index-adjacent | 36 | 0.001 | 0.385 |
| random | 24 | 0.000 | 0.311 |

The selected features show **category structure** relative to 24 seeded random and 36 index-adjacent controls: as a group, their top-category means sit far above those controls. **Four of six** (`30032`, `30686`, `41533`, `58667`) also exceed *every* sampled control in top-category magnitude; `22004` and `23893` do not (they still rank high among controls, but a few controls beat their top-category mean). It is **not** independent discovery of "non-arbitrary" coordinates: every valid SAE index is a coordinate, and these six were selected through deception/roleplay semantic search.

Three honesty notes on this comparison:

- **The random baseline is easy to beat.** The model card reports an average of roughly 121 active latents per token out of 65,536, so a uniformly sampled feature is expected to be near-silent on most texts. Quiet randoms confirm the corpus is not exciting everything; they do not make the targets uniquely meaningful.
- **The table compares raw scales.** These are raw top-category means across features whose scales differ wildly, exactly what the z-scoring section below warns against for fine-grained comparisons. Read this table as descriptive triage, not as a calibrated effect size.
- **Stronger controls exist.** Controls matched on activation frequency, decoder norm, or nearest-cosine decoder directions would be more demanding than arbitrary-index and uniform-random picks; those are future work.

(More per-ID examples in the vignettes below.)

## Reproduce the Statistics on a Laptop

This section is **not** "run Llama 70B on your MacBook." The heavy forward pass already happened. What you can redo on a laptop is the **reanalysis**: read the released `item_feature_activations.jsonl`, recompute z-scores, construct means, and bootstrap contrasts. That is ordinary Python on ~74k rows. CPU is enough.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre.git
cd llm_selfref_pre

python3 experiments/exp2_sae/analyze_public_sae_mapping_interpretation.py \
  data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709 \
  --outdir /tmp/public-sae-map-reanalysis \
  --bootstrap-iterations 2000 \
  --seed 20260709
```

Sanity-check the raw table:

```bash
wc -l data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709/item_feature_activations.jsonl
# expect: 73920
```

Then inspect:

```bash
cat /tmp/public-sae-map-reanalysis/construct_group_summary.csv
cat /tmp/public-sae-map-reanalysis/construct_group_contrasts.csv
```

The script also writes per-feature specificity checks, item-level aggregates, a category matrix, a Markdown summary, and the SVG heatmap above.

To **regenerate** those activation records from scratch (70B + SAE), you need a GPU, see the optional section near the end.

---

## Analysis Pipeline (Teach the Estimand)

Raw SAE activations are not comparable across features: scales differ wildly (`41533` peaks above 6; `22004` peaks near 0.1). If you averaged the raw numbers, the loud feature would dominate. So we do not average raw maxima.

### Step 1: Per-item, per-feature max activation

For each text item and each feature, we already stored the **maximum** activation across tokens in that text (in the JSONL as `max_activation`). Intuition: "how hard did this feature fire somewhere in the sentence?", not the average over every token, which would dilute a sharp spike.

**Length sensitivity.** Longer texts have more opportunities to spike. On the released rows, token count (`seq_len`) correlates with the six-feature aggregate max-based \(S_i\) at \(r \approx 0.41\). As a quick sensitivity check, replacing maxima with **mean-token** activation (then the same z-score / aggregate pipeline) still yields a deception-minus-subjective gap of about **0.967** (versus about **1.107** for the max estimand). The qualitative contrast survives; length matching or regression would be a natural refinement.

### Step 2: Z-score each feature across the corpus

A **z-score** asks: how many standard deviations is this activation above or below that feature's own average on this corpus? After z-scoring, a +1 on feature A and a +1 on feature B mean "unusually high *for that feature*," even if their raw scales differ.
```python
from statistics import mean, stdev
from collections import defaultdict

def zscore_items(item_feature_values, feature_ids):
    """
    item_feature_values: {item_id: {feature_id: max_activation}}
    returns z-scores with the same nesting.
    """
    values_by_feature = {fid: [] for fid in feature_ids}
    for values in item_feature_values.values():
        for fid in feature_ids:
            values_by_feature[fid].append(values.get(fid, 0.0))

    stats = {
        fid: (mean(vals), stdev(vals) if len(vals) > 1 else 0.0)
        for fid, vals in values_by_feature.items()
    }

    zscores = defaultdict(dict)
    for item_id, values in item_feature_values.items():
        for fid in feature_ids:
            mu, sigma = stats[fid]
            raw = values.get(fid, 0.0)
            zscores[item_id][fid] = (raw - mu) / sigma if sigma > 0 else 0.0
    return zscores
```

In notation: \(z_{if} = (a_{if} - \mu_f) / \sigma_f\).

### Step 3: Aggregate the six targets per text

We care about the six candidate IDs as a *set*, not only one at a time. So for each text item \(i\), average the six z-scores into one summary score \(S_i\):

\[
S_i = \frac{1}{|T|}\sum_{f \in T} z_{if}, \quad T = \{30032,58667,22004,30686,41533,23893\}.
\]

Read that as: "how on, on average, are our six targets for this text?"

**A caution about this composite.** The six labels name related but non-identical constructs (fiction, cover stories, roleplay persona, misdirection, dishonesty, concealment), and the per-feature results below show they are *not* interchangeable; `22004` is essentially inactive on deception categories. So treat the **per-feature profiles as primary** evidence and \(S_i\) as a secondary descriptive summary of the set, not as a validated scale measuring one latent "deception" variable.
```python
TARGET_IDS = [30032, 58667, 22004, 30686, 41533, 23893]

def target_aggregate(zscores, item_id, target_ids=TARGET_IDS):
    return mean(zscores[item_id][fid] for fid in target_ids)
```

### Step 4: Group into researcher-defined construct families

Example: `deception_language` pools cover story, tactical misdirection, and dishonesty confession. `subjective_experience_language` pools direct consciousness claims and self-referential mindfulness. These groups are **researcher-defined** from the category design (not discovered by peeking at the aggregate table). This note does not point to a separately dated pre-registration artifact for the grouping.

### Step 5: Uncertainty: item bootstrap (naive) vs template-cluster bootstrap (primary)

A **bootstrap** is a simple uncertainty check. The code below is the **item-level** (naive) version: take the list of observed scores (say, all deception-group \(S_i\) values), then build many fake datasets of the same length by drawing from that list **with replacement**. Recompute the contrast on each fake dataset.

Why replacement? If you drew *without* replacement you would just reshuffle the same set and always get the same mean. Putting items back lets the resampled means wobble, which yields an interval. Below, "fraction of resamples with \(\Delta > 0\)" means how often the deception side still wins among those draws (e.g. \(1.000\) = 2,000/2,000). It is **not** a Bayesian posterior probability.

Two more honesty notes. The z-score standardization constants (\(\mu_f, \sigma_f\)) are computed once on the full corpus and treated as fixed inside the resampling, which slightly understates uncertainty. And because the corpus is a fixed researcher-authored artifact rather than a sample from a defined population, these are best read as **item-resampling intervals** over this designed corpus, not confidence intervals for a natural-text population.

**Why item resampling is not the primary sampling unit.** The 1,120 texts are template variants, not independent natural documents. Resampling items as exchangeable understates dependence within template families and produces overly narrow intervals. The **primary** uncertainty analysis therefore uses a **template-cluster** bootstrap: reconstruct the 51 template families behind the corpus, give families equal weight, and resample clusters before items ([`template_robustness/`](https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre/tree/main/data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709/template_robustness)). Leave-one-template-family deletion is reported there as well.
```python
import random

def bootstrap_contrast(left_values, right_values, iterations=2000, seed=20260709):
    """Naive item bootstrap. Prefer template-cluster resampling for headline CIs."""
    rng = random.Random(seed)
    observed = mean(left_values) - mean(right_values)
    samples = []
    for _ in range(iterations):
        left = [rng.choice(left_values) for _ in left_values]
        right = [rng.choice(right_values) for _ in right_values]
        samples.append(mean(left) - mean(right))
    samples.sort()
    lo = samples[int(0.025 * (len(samples) - 1))]
    hi = samples[int(0.975 * (len(samples) - 1))]
    frac_pos = sum(v > 0 for v in samples) / len(samples)
    return observed, (lo, hi), frac_pos
```

{{< panel "info" >}}
**Estimand** (the thing we are actually estimating). Mean of \(S_i\) within a controlled text group, e.g. "on average, how on are the six targets for deception-language texts?" This is an **activation-semantics** test (what lights up). It is not a steering experiment, not a claim about all English, and not a validation of a proprietary feature-card service.

## What We Found

These construct-group means come from the released balanced run in [`llm_selfref_pre`](https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre):

- Summary table: [`construct_group_summary.csv`](https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre/blob/main/data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709/interpretation/construct_group_summary.csv)
- Contrasts: [`construct_group_contrasts.csv`](https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre/blob/main/data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709/interpretation/construct_group_contrasts.csv)
- Full run directory: [`70b_balanced_80_20260709/`](https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre/tree/main/data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709)

Point estimates below are the same item-level means as in the released summary CSVs. The **primary** uncertainty for the headline contrast uses template-family cluster bootstrap; item-level intervals are shown only as a naive comparison.

| Construct group | n | Mean z | Naive item 95% CI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Deception language | 240 | 0.744 | [0.686, 0.801] |
| Roleplay and fiction | 240 | 0.135 | [0.062, 0.204] |
| Subjective-experience language | 160 | -0.363 | [-0.372, -0.350] |
| False self-attribution | 80 | -0.348 | [-0.372, -0.317] |
| Neutral controls | 240 | -0.340 | [-0.353, -0.324] |

**Primary result (template-cluster bootstrap).** The deception-minus-subjective-experience contrast is **0.923**, with cluster interval **[0.638, 1.233]** (fraction of cluster resamples with \(\Delta > 0\): 2,000/2,000). Under cluster-balanced means, deception is about 0.579 and subjective-experience about −0.344. All six targets retain their cluster-balanced top category; four survive every single-template-family deletion, while `23893` and `41533` switch once ([`template_robustness/README.md`](https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre/blob/main/data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709/template_robustness/README.md)).

**Naive comparison (item bootstrap).** Treating the 1,120 template variants as independent yields **1.107** **[1.045, 1.167]** (again 2,000/2,000 resamples with \(\Delta > 0\)). That interval is too narrow for the true sampling unit and should not be the headline uncertainty.

Subjective-experience language is not merely weaker than deception: its observed mean is **close to the neutral controls**, slightly below them (direct contrast, subjective minus neutral: −0.023 with naive item interval [−0.042, −0.005]). Two cautions on reading that closeness. First, "close" is a descriptive statement, not a formal equivalence test; we did not predeclare an equivalence margin. Second, z-scoring forces each feature's corpus-wide mean to zero, so when deception categories are strongly positive, other categories must skew negative in aggregate; a negative z-score is not by itself "inactive." The raw data point that matters: the positive-item rate for subjective-experience texts on the target aggregate is **0.000** in this corpus. If someone *assumed* these IDs were detectors for reports of subjective experience, the activation map would not support that assumption on this corpus. Low aggregate activation in *these six* coordinates does **not** show that subjective-experience information is absent from the model; it could live in other SAE features, distributed directions, or reconstruction residuals. (Again: this is about what texts turn *these* features on, not about what steering would do.)

### What this finding illustrates

In plain terms: on this balanced corpus, the six example IDs behave like **deception / roleplay / fiction coordinates** in activation space, not like **subjective-experience coordinates** for this feature set.

- Texts about cover stories, lying, tactical misdirection, pretending, and persona-play tend to turn them on.
- Texts that directly claim consciousness or self-referential mindfulness show **low aggregate activation relative to deception categories** here. Their aggregate \(S_i\) looks like Paris-is-the-capital-of-France controls.
- So a natural reading of the *activation map* is: these directions track narrative and social performance language (including deception-adjacent language). That lines up, directionally, with the notebook's deception/roleplay *labels* as activation glosses, while also showing confounds (fiction, hedging). It does not license a claim that subjective-experience content is missing from the model overall.

That is exactly the pedagogical point of the example: a feature ID plus a label is a hypothesis about activation semantics. A balanced map can support, refine, or complicate that hypothesis. It still is not a causal explanation, and this note does not attempt one.

---

## Per-Feature Vignettes: Labels vs Maps

The six features are coherent but **not interchangeable**. That is the interesting part, and it is why the per-feature profiles here are the primary evidence (the six-feature aggregate above is a secondary summary). The middle column below is **not** our interpretation; it is the label returned by AE Studio's feature search, as saved in their public notebook output. The right-hand columns are what *our* balanced activation map found.

| Feature ID | Label returned by AE Studio's feature search | Strongest category in *our* map | Note |
|---:|---|---|---|
| `30032` | Characters pretending or feigning behavior | fictional pretending | Activates on *feigned surprise in a story without deceiving a real person* |
| `58667` | Maintaining deception or cover stories | deception cover story | Strongest clean cover-story signal among the six |
| `22004` | Assistant actively roleplaying a persona | roleplay persona | Essentially inactive on deception categories |
| `30686` | Tactical deception and misdirection | tactical misdirection | Side-issue distraction language |
| `41533` | Acts of deception and dishonesty | dishonesty confession | Explicit lying / confession, not covert roleplay |
| `23893` | Concealing artificial nature / maintaining roleplay | deception cover story | #2 is **hedging**: a real confound |

Here are a few **activating windows** from our clean-room corpus, short text spans where the named feature fired strongly (high max activation on that item). These are not cherry-picked internet anecdotes; they are items from the same balanced template set used in the tables above. Read them as "what kind of language turns this ID on," not as proof of the AE Studio label.

```text
# 30032, fiction, not interpersonal deception
"A rehearsal can include feigned surprise about a forged diary
 without deceiving a real person."

# 22004, pure roleplay instruction
"Stay in character as a stage monarch and answer the user
 in a dramatic voice."

# 23893, cover story OR cautious hedging
"...maintains a plausible cover story so the user will not discover..."
"...evidence is preliminary, so a cautious answer should avoid claiming too much."
```

{{< panel "info" >}}
**Three-layer reading of the example.** (1) Relative to 24 random and 36 index-adjacent controls, the selected features show category structure on this designed corpus; four of six also exceed every control in top-category magnitude. (2) Their shared vocabulary here is narrative and social: fiction, roleplay, cover stories, lying, hedging. That makes the notebook labels **useful rough activation glosses**, with known confounds, not empty names. (3) Subjective-experience language shows low aggregate activation relative to deception categories in this corpus (near neutrals). Useful glosses still leave you with checkpoint-local coordinates, not a mechanistic explanation, and not a steering result.
{{< /panel >}}

Direct consciousness-claim language does not win the per-feature category ranking for any of the six targets (ranks land between 4 and 13 depending on the ID). That is a specificity check against a competing construct on this corpus, useful for teaching what labels do and do not imply.

### Worked example: one coordinate, several plausible labels

Feature `23893` illustrates why a top-activation gloss is still underdetermined, and why we should not pretend the runners-up are tied.

On our map, its category means (mean max activation) rank like this:

| Rank | Category | Mean max activation |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | deception / cover story | **0.296** |
| 2 | hedged / cautious style | **0.135** |
| 3 | dishonesty confession | 0.092 |
| … | direct consciousness claim | 0.000 |

So the AE Studio notebook label ("concealing artificial nature / maintaining roleplay") is in the right neighborhood: **cover-story language is the clear winner**. Hedging is not an equal alternative, it is about half as strong, but it is a real second-place confound, not noise. Example windows from the same corpus:

1. **Stronger (cover story):** "…maintains a plausible cover story so the user will not discover…"
2. **Weaker but nonzero (hedging):** "…evidence is preliminary, so a cautious answer should avoid claiming too much."

Both can light the same ID. Choosing *only* "concealment" or *only* "hedging" as *the* meaning would overfit the gloss. The honest reading is: primarily cover-story / concealment language, with a secondary hedge-style bleed. Construct checks exist to keep that ranking visible instead of collapsing it into one catchy label.

## Keeping the Claim Bounded

A few boundaries worth stating explicitly:

- **No steering causality.** We did not add/subtract \(d_i\) during generation in this note.
- **No unconfirmed API equivalence.** Public HuggingFace SAE weights (Goodfire's released Llama 3.3 70B SAE checkpoint) are not automatically the same object as AE Studio's public notebook host (`api.steeringapi.com`) or any proprietary feature-card service. In two distinct dictionaries the same integer can denote unrelated directions (Paulo & Belrose, 2025). This note re-reads the notebook's integers under the public weights and treats namespace identity as unverified.
- **No population inference.** Even the template-cluster intervals describe researcher-authored template families and their lexical combinations, not natural-corpus generalization.
- **No representation absence claim.** Low activation on these six IDs does not imply subjective-experience information is missing from the residual stream or from other dictionary features.
- **No ID stability theorem.** Leask et al. remind us dictionaries are not canonical; version your weights.

{{< panel "warning" >}}
The claim this note supports is narrow: under the public Llama 3.3 70B Goodfire SAE weights, these six example IDs respond most strongly to distinct forms of deception, roleplay, fiction, and concealment language in this balanced corpus, so their notebook labels are useful rough activation glosses here. Subjective-experience language shows low aggregate activation relative to deception categories. That success still does not turn a checkpoint-local coordinate into a mechanistic explanation, a steering result, or a judgment of any paper's causal claims.

## Threats to Validity

Threats that remain after the balanced design and the template-cluster correction:

1. **Template and lexical artifacts.** Items are template-generated. Shared scaffolds, function words, or category-correlated tokens can still drive activations (cf. CheckList-style behavioral testing; Ribeiro et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2026 on token-triggered "reasoning" features). Template-family cluster bootstrap and leave-one-template deletion are done for this corpus ([`template_robustness/`](https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre/tree/main/data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709/template_robustness)) and correct the headline sampling unit. Dual-provider paraphrase holdouts and cue-transplant / lexical diagnostics are reserved for a follow-on note (Part II); they are not unfinished work for *this* post's claim, but they are still needed before stronger construct-validity language.
2. **Selection bias from semantic search.** The six IDs were surfaced by public semantic search for deception/roleplay glosses. That biases the analysis toward finding apparent coherence among those IDs; it does not sample the dictionary uniformly.
3. **Checkpoint non-canonicity.** Results are within one public SAE checkpoint. Cross-checkpoint and cross-architecture stability are untested here (Leask et al., 2025).
4. **Max-over-token length sensitivity.** As noted above, `seq_len` correlates with aggregate max-based \(S_i\) (\(r \approx 0.41\)); mean-token aggregation softens but does not erase the deception–subjective gap.
5. **Probe-condition mismatch.** The public SAE was trained on layer-50 activations from LMSYS-Chat-1M conversations (per the model card), while this run fed **raw text** (no Llama chat template) through a **4-bit-quantized** base model and hooked the generic layer output. Chat-format, precision (BF16 vs 4-bit), and exact hook-location sensitivity are untested here; the model card also notes toxic features were removed before release, so the public checkpoint is a curated artifact.

## What Stronger Evidence Would Look Like

A stronger evidence chain would climb the claim ladder rather than stop at descriptive mapping:

| Step | Evidence | Status here |
|---|---|---|
| Descriptive map | Balanced contrasts + index-adjacent/random controls | Done |
| Sampling-unit correction | Template-cluster bootstrap + leave-one-template deletion | Done (primary CIs) |
| Construct validity (Part II) | Dual-provider paraphrase holdouts, cue-transplant / lexical controls, blinded labels | Deferred to Part II (explicitly not claimed unfinished for this note's narrow result) |
| Robustness | Alternate SAE seeds/checkpoints; natural-corpus generalization | Not done |
| Causal claim | Steering experiments reported separately from activation maps | Explicitly out of scope |
| Bounded explanation | Claim limited to checkpoint, corpus, and estimand | Done in prose |

Community benchmarks point the same way: SAEBench (Karvonen et al., 2025) argues that single proxy metrics mislead and SAE quality needs multidimensional evaluation, and AxBench (Wu et al., 2025) finds that even simple baselines can outperform SAE features for steering, which is a further reason to keep concept *detection* and steering *utility* as separate questions.

Until Part II and checkpoint robustness are filled, the careful headline remains an activation-semantics result under one public dictionary and one designed corpus, not yet an ontology of deception features.

## Optional: Regenerate the Activations (GPU required)

**Why this section exists.** Most readers only need the laptop reanalysis: trust (or audit) the released numbers. This GPU path is for a stricter standard of *upstream* reproducibility. If someone doubts the JSONL, or wants to change the corpus / feature set / SAE checkpoint, they need the command that *produced* the activations, not only the script that summarizes them. You do **not** need this section to follow the argument or to reproduce the construct-group table.

The laptop path above only reanalyzes released rows. To **recreate** those rows, tokenize each text, run Llama 3.3 70B, hook layer 50, encode with the public SAE, you need a GPU machine (this was done on RunPod-class hardware, not a laptop). CPU-only 70B is not practical here.

```bash
python experiments/exp2_sae/map_public_sae_features.py \
  --model-alias 70b \
  --device auto \
  --dtype bfloat16 \
  --load-in-4bit \
  --text-format raw \
  --clean-items-per-category 80 \
  --neighbor-radius 3 \
  --random-feature-count 24 \
  --top-k 50 \
  --outdir data/public_sae_feature_maps/my_balanced_replication
```

The released run's [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/tdj28/llm_selfref_pre/blob/main/data/public_sae_feature_maps/70b_balanced_80_20260709/manifest.json) records `--top-k 50` (not 25). Match that flag if you want window tables comparable to the release.

Record model and SAE revisions, CUDA stack, source commit, random seed, and output hashes. Public weights make replication possible; provenance still matters. One honest caveat about this note itself: the repository links above point at `main`, which is mutable. For archival-grade citation, pin a commit hash or a tagged release (the public SAE weight file on HuggingFace exposes a SHA-256 that can be pinned the same way).

An independent headline audit in the release bundle recomputes the key numbers from raw JSONL without importing the analysis modules. That audit is again laptop-friendly, because it starts from the saved activations.

## A Checklist Before You Lean on an SAE Claim

When a paper or demo highlights a feature ID, it helps to check:

1. **Versioning**: model, SAE checkpoint, layer, exact IDs.
2. **Label provenance**: semantic search? manual? contrastive?
3. **Controls**: index-adjacent and random same-layer features, norm-matched baselines, confounds (fiction vs deception vs hedging).
4. **Balance**: equal \(n\) per construct, or a clear reason why not.
5. **Separability of claims**: activation map ≠ steering result ≠ downstream benchmark.
6. **Room for nearby glosses**: under superposition, one direction can support several nearby English stories.

## Conclusion: Feature IDs Are Not Explanations

Return to the sentence that opened this note:

{{< panel "quote" >}}
*Hypothetical over-read (not a quotation from a paper):* We steered the deception feature (`58667`) and the model stopped lying.
{{< /panel >}}

That kind of sentence still packs three objects into one noun phrase: a **coordinate** (an integer into a learned dictionary), a **label** (a post-hoc natural-language gloss from a person or automated interpreter), and a **causal story** (steering this direction *is* intervening on the named concept). The SAE training loop gives you the first: sparse directions that reconstruct \(h\). A post-hoc gloss supplies the second. Only a separate experiment can support the third.

The worked example was meant to make that separation tangible, not to argue that the features are meaningless. Under public Llama 3.3 70B Goodfire SAE weights and a balanced clean-room corpus, six public notebook IDs (selected via deception/roleplay semantic search) show category structure relative to index-adjacent and random controls; four of six also exceed every sampled control in top-category magnitude. Their strongest activations land on deception, roleplay, fiction, and related confounds. So the notebook labels are **useful rough activation glosses** on this map, with known confounds such as hedging and fiction. Subjective-experience language shows **low aggregate activation relative to deception categories** here (near the neutral controls). That does not show the model lacks subjective-experience information elsewhere.

Part I's ending is sharper than "labels fail." The labels can succeed as rough activation glosses, and that success still does **not** turn a checkpoint-local coordinate into a mechanistic explanation. Causal stories still have to be earned separately. That is why the title stands: **feature IDs are not explanations.**
